# Coding Sample for MA Thesis

The code below is a sample of the analyses I conducted for my thesis (my writing sample). It should complement and elaborate upon the analysis section. My thesis broadly explored the relationship between math anxiety, retrieval practice, and math performance. The following sections are included in this sample: data cleaning, power analyses, t-tests, regressions, causal mediation analysis, and data visualization.
